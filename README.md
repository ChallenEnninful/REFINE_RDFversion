# REFINE: Reachability-based Trajectory Design using Robust Feedback Linearization and Zonotopes
Introduction

# Installation Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:
- MATLAB 2021b or higher
- [CORA 2018](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/) for Forward Reachable Sets representation and computation

# Overview
## 0. Installation
- Properly install the above toolboxes and have them added in the search path of MATLAB.
- Run [`install.m`](https://github.com/jinsunl/REFINE/blob/main/install.m).
- Change split.m


## 1. Offline reachability analysis
control parameter `P = (p_u,p_y)`



## 2.
